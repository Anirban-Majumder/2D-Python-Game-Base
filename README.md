Before running any commands, make sure you're in the source directory. Also, be sure to use the correct Python versions/commands
for your system. For example, your Python interpreter may be run by calling `python3.8` rather than `python3`. In these examples,
I will be using `python`.

```
git clone https://github.com/anirbanmajumder0/Voice_Assistant
